# CHAR INVADERS #

_A simple space invaders game made in Javascript, HTML and CSS as part of the 01Founders course_

Currently a work in progress, but is fully playable with working sound and a pause menu. Relied heavily on [max on tech's](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL30AETbxgR-cTo-zb1iUxL4mwq0n9Vj_U) Space Invaders tutorial but with my own features and additions. I previously made this before with a group (as it was required on the course) but I created this for my own learning and experimentation. 

### How to Play ###
Move the spaceship with the left and right arrow keys. Press space to shoot. The game ends when either all the UFOs are taken down or when the player gets hit by an enemy laser.

### How to Run ##
I recommend installing the VS Code extension Liveserver, then the game can be run simply by pressing the Go Live button in the bottom right corner of the window. Otherwise right-click the HTML file and click on 'Open With' alongside your preferred browser.
